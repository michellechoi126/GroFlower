## User Stories
A Windowsill user is someone who wants to relive the 90's Tomagotchi experience through taking care of and raising a digital pet plant so that they can feel like they have a green thumb even if they don't.

#### Baseline User can:
- As a plant parent, you can name your plant, so that you can start to build your relationship with your unique plant.
- As a plant parent, you must water the plant so it doesn't die of thirst
- As a plant parent, you can expose your plant to more sunlight for photosynthesis to happen
- As a plant parent, you may occasionally open the window for fresh air and watch it sway in the wind so it can shake off the dust accumulating on its leaves
- As a plant parent, you have the pleasure of watching as the plant grows bigger every leaf it accumulates in the Growth Tracker until it reaches full maturity of 4 leaves in the tracker.

#### Opportunities to advance the user experience further:
- optimize CSS Styling to be responsive and adaptable to smaller screens
- purchase more plants
- fertilize plants to grow more flowers
- turn on GroLight for faster growth
- mist plants to let plants shine
- propagate or plant new seeds
